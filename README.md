# Diabetics-Prediciton-Using-Decision-Tree-and-Randon-Forest-Algorithm
A Random Forest and Decision Tree model is built for diabetes data with outcome as the output variable.

> Random Forest and Decision Tree are both popular machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. While Decision Tree is a standalone algorithm, Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that utilizes multiple Decision Trees.

**Decision Tree:**
1. A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like model that makes decisions based on the features of the input data. 
2. It recursively splits the data based on the values of different features, creating a tree-like structure. Each internal node of the tree represents a test on a specific feature, and each leaf node represents a class label or a predicted value. 
3. The decision-making process starts at the root node and follows the branches down to the leaf nodes, where the final decision or prediction is made.

**Key features of Decision Trees:**

1. Easy to understand and interpret, as the decision-making process is represented as a tree structure.
2. Can handle both categorical and numerical data.
3. Can capture non-linear relationships between features.
4. Prone to overfitting, especially if the tree is grown too deep.


**Random Forest:**
1. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple Decision Trees to make predictions.
2. It constructs a multitude of Decision Trees, each trained on a random subset of the training data and using a random subset of features.
3. The predictions from individual trees are then aggregated to make the final prediction. 
4. The idea behind Random Forest is to reduce overfitting and improve the overall performance by averaging out the predictions of multiple trees.

**Key features of Random Forest:**

1. Reduces overfitting by combining predictions from multiple trees.
2. Handles high-dimensional data well and can handle a large number of features.
3. Provides measures of feature importance, indicating which features are more influential in the model's predictions.
4. Generally performs well and is less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning compared to individual Decision Trees.

> In summary, Decision Trees are simple and interpretable models that can be prone to overfitting, while Random Forest is an ensemble method that improves performance by combining multiple Decision Trees and reducing overfitting. Random Forest is often preferred when higher prediction accuracy is desired, while Decision Trees can be useful for gaining insights and understanding the decision-making process.
